To start web server

This is the way the way the most recent flasks docs showed to start web service

$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
$ flask run --host=0.0.0.0

Believe this to be the older versions way for starting the server

$ python hello.py runserver --host 0.0.0.0

The --host 0.0.0.0 makes the server available to hosts outside your local host
It also disables debugging
